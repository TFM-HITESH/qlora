# Frontend UI Specification: Orchestration Website

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications and architectural plan for the frontend user interface of the QLoRA orchestration website. The primary objective is to provide an intuitive and robust platform for users to manage datasets, configure and deploy QLoRA-enabled audio models, and initiate training processes. Adhering to modern web development best practices, this specification details the chosen technology stack, core functionalities, and design principles.

## 2. Technology Stack
To ensure an industry-grade, scalable, and maintainable frontend, the following technologies have been selected:

-   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework for Production)
    -   **Rationale:** Provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for performance and SEO, API routes for backend integration, and a robust development experience.
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    -   **Rationale:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development, highly customizable designs, and ensures consistency across the application without writing custom CSS.
-   **Component Library:** [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
    -   **Rationale:** A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It offers unstyled, accessible components that can be easily customized to fit the project's design system, promoting consistency and accelerating development.
-   **Animation/Effects Library:** [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)
    -   **Rationale:** Provides visually appealing and modern UI components and animations that can enhance user experience and provide a polished, professional aesthetic.
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    -   **Rationale:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code quality, readability, and maintainability, especially in larger codebases.
