## 3. System Design Specification (SDS)

### 3.1. Architectural Overview
The QLoRA Orchestration Service will adopt a microservices-oriented architecture, separating concerns into distinct, independently deployable services. This design promotes scalability, fault isolation, and technology flexibility. The primary components include a Frontend UI, a Backend API Gateway, and a Training Orchestration Service.

-   **Responsibilities:** Exposing RESTful API endpoints, request routing, input validation, authentication/authorization enforcement, communication with backend services.

#### 3.2.3. Authentication Service
-   **Technology Stack:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for user data).
-   **Responsibilities:** User registration, login, token generation (JWT), password hashing.

#### 3.2.4. Database Service
-   **Technology Stack:** PostgreSQL (for structured data like user profiles, dataset metadata, model metadata, training job records).
-   **Responsibilities:** Persistent storage and retrieval of application data.

#### 3.2.5. Training Orchestration Service
-   **Technology Stack:** FastAPI (Python), Celery/RabbitMQ (for job queueing), Docker/Kubernetes (for container orchestration).
-   **Responsibilities:** Receiving training requests, queuing jobs, provisioning and managing training workers (e.g., on Jetson Nano emulators or VMs), monitoring job progress, collecting results.

#### 3.2.6. Training Workers/Containers
-   **Technology Stack:** Python, PyTorch, `bitsandbytes`, `peft`, specific video-text model libraries.
-   **Responsibilities:** Executing the actual QLoRA fine-tuning process on provisioned hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano container emulator), accessing datasets and models, logging metrics.

#### 3.2.7. Model/Dataset Storage

### 3.3. Data Flow (Example: Initiating a Training Job)

1.  User interacts with Frontend UI to configure a new training job.
2.  Frontend sends a `POST /trainings` request to the Backend API Gateway.
3.  API Gateway validates the request, authenticates the user, and forwards it to the Training Orchestration Service.
4.  Training Orchestration Service validates input, creates a new job record in the Database Service, and adds the job to the Job Queue.
5.  A free Training Worker picks up the job from the Job Queue.
6.  Training Worker pulls the specified dataset and model from Model/Dataset Storage.
7.  Training Worker executes the QLoRA fine-tuning process.
8.  During training, the worker sends progress updates and logs to the Monitoring/Logging Service.
9.  Upon completion, the worker saves the fine-tuned QLoRA adapters to Model/Dataset Storage and updates the job status in the Database Service.
10. Frontend UI periodically polls the API Gateway (`GET /trainings/{job_id}`) to update the user on job status and progress.

## 4. Module Design and Implementation (Conceptual)

### 4.1. User Module
-   **Entities:** User (username, email, hashed_password, roles).
-   **API Endpoints:** `/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/users/me`.
-   **Key Logic:** Password hashing (Bcrypt), JWT generation and validation.

### 4.2. Dataset Module
-   **Entities:** Dataset (id, name, description, source_type, source_path, status, owner_id).
-   **API Endpoints:** `/datasets`, `/datasets/{id}`.
-   **Key Logic:** File upload handling, metadata storage, status tracking (e.g., `processing`, `ready`, `error`).

### 4.3. Model Module
-   **Entities:** Model (id, name, description, model_type, base_architecture, source_path, status, owner_id).
-   **API Endpoints:** `/models`, `/models/{id}`.
-   **Key Logic:** Model registration, metadata storage.

### 4.4. Training Module
-   **Entities:** TrainingJob (id, model_id, dataset_id, params, status, progress, owner_id, logs_path, results_path).
-   **API Endpoints:** `/trainings`, `/trainings/{id}`, `/trainings/{id}/stop`.
-   **Key Logic:** Job queuing, worker assignment, status updates, result storage.

### 4.5. Core QLoRA Fine-tuning Logic (within Training Worker)
-   **Components:**
    -   `model_loader.py`: Loads base audio-text models.
    -   `qlora_injector.py`: Applies 4-bit quantization and injects LoRA adapters.
    -   `data_processor.py`: Handles audio signal processing, text tokenization, and batching.
