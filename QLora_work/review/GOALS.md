# 🎯 Q1 Journal Submission Checklist: QLoRA for Audio-Text Models

This document outlines the must-have contributions and advanced innovations required to maximize your chances of Q1 journal acceptance (e.g., TPAMI, TMLR, CVPR, ICCV, ACL Findings, NeurIPS D&B).

## ✅ Core Contributions (Minimum Bar for Q1 Acceptance)

### 1. First Application of QLoRA to Audio-Text Models
- [ ] Integrate QLoRA into existing audio-language models (e.g., Whisper, Conformer).
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility: open-source code, configs, training scripts.

### 2. Memory & Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Evaluate on standard audio-text datasets:
  - Speech-to-Text: LibriSpeech, Common Voice
  - Audio Retrieval: AudioCaps, Clotho
- [ ] Compare:
  - Full fine-tuning
  - LoRA
  - QLoRA
  - Other PEFT baselines (e.g., prefix-tuning, adapters)
- [ ] Report:
  - Memory usage (VRAM during training and inference)
  - Accuracy metrics (BLEU, CIDEr, Recall@K)
  - Training time, latency, FLOPs

### 3. Ablation Studies
- [ ] Vary key hyperparameters:
  - Bit-width (4-bit, 8-bit, hybrid)
  - Rank size (r)
  - Adapter placement (text-only, vision-only, cross-modal)
- [ ] Analyze tradeoffs vs performance

## 🚀 Advanced Q1-Level Contributions (Novelty & Research Value)

### 4. Temporal-Aware QLoRA (Algorithmic Innovation)
- [ ] Design temporally dynamic QLoRA modules:
  - Rank conditioned on motion or keyframe scores
  - Temporal gating (adaptive adapter usage per frame)
- [ ] Optionally fuse with temporal attention or memory mechanisms

### 5. Cross-Modal Rank Allocation
- [ ] Implement adaptive rank assignment:
  - Different ranks for visual vs textual modalities
  - Rank modulation based on information density (e.g., frame entropy)
- [ ] Report rank-performance tradeoffs

### 6. Quantization-Aware Frame Selection
- [ ] Develop a lightweight entropy- or scene-aware frame sampler
- [ ] Integrate this with QLoRA pipeline
- [ ] Show substantial efficiency gains with minimal performance drop

### 7. Theoretical Analysis & Scaling Laws
- [ ] Analyze performance vs rank size, modality, and bit-width
- [ ] Fit and visualize Pareto frontier:
  - Accuracy vs memory vs latency

## 🌍 Optional Extensions (Bonus Points for Generalization)

### 8. Generalization Beyond Video-Text
- [ ] Extend QLoRA to:
  - Audio-video-text models
  - Multilingual video QA
  - Instruction-tuned multimodal LMs
- [ ] Use datasets like Ego4D, HowTo100M, VATEX (multilingual)

### 9. Unified QLoRA Framework
- [ ] Build a modular framework or library:
  - Plug-and-play for encoders/decoders across modalities
  - Supports various quantization strategies and LoRA configurations

## ⚠️ Acceptance Guidelines (Be Realistic)

✅ **You’re likely to be accepted if:**
- You combine at least **2–3 novel contributions**
- You outperform or match LoRA/full tuning on downstream tasks
- You open-source everything for reproducibility
- Your paper is well-structured, clear, and honest

❌ **You’re likely to be rejected if:**
- You only apply QLoRA without adding any innovation
- Your results are weaker than LoRA or full tuning
- You use weak baselines or perform limited experimentation
